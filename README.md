# Frontend Architecture

Welcome to the frontend documentation. This repository houses a high-performance, scalable React application built with TypeScript and Vite.

## 🏗 High-Level Architecture
We follow a Modular Monolith approach, prioritizing separation of concerns and predictable data flow. The architecture is designed to be "feature-first" rather than "role-first."

## Core Tech Stack
Framework: React 18+ (Functional Components, Hooks)

## Language: TypeScript (Strict Mode)

## State Management: TanStack Query (Server State) + Zustand (Client State)

## Styling: Tailwind CSS + Headless UI

## Build Tool: Vite
